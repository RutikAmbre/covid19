# covid19 Data Analysis using python

Covid19 Dataset : The dataset included covid 19 cases in countries from jan to april 

Data preprocessing was done to remove unwanted columns and data was grouped as per the country 

Analysis : Analysis of rise and fall of cases in China, Italy, Spain via line graph.
           Finding the maximum infected cases of each country by difference, as this tells the maximum cases rise (diff b/w day and day before)
           
Second dataset is world happiness report dataset, which consists of GDP, life expectancy, happiness, generosity..
Joining the max infected dataframe with the happiness

Analysis: Finding the correlation b/w each of factors with infected rate
          Plotting the regplot of GDP vs Infected rate, social support vs max infected rate, life expectancy vs max infected rate
          Out of this GDP was quite well fitting so that was the main factor responsible and was found through analysis.
